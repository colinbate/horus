Yes this is another site engine. Having used and developed my own site software for over seven years now, I thought it was time for a fresh start. I have learned so much in that time. Looking back, I understand why I did what I did, but it doesn't make me any happier about it. So the plan is to pick up and move to a new system in a new language. That way I can't just reuse my old code even if I were tempted.

The plan is that this will be built using Ruby with Sinatra providing all of the useful bits to give me a head start. I'm really keen on the idea of having a front controller for the site and Sinatra makes that easy.

And I've decided that this time I'm going to develop this out in the open. That way anyone who finds it useful can take advantage of it and even help me make it better. However, at the end of the day, I'm building this for me.
